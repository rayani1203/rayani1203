- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rayan!

- ðŸ‘€ I'm someone who's always curious and loves to learn about how the world around me works. Whether this be through solving problems, understanding new ideas, or just asking questions, I love to explore new topics and immerse myself in the things I love.

- ðŸ”¥ Some things I love to do in my own time include playing sports and listening to music. I've played a huge variety of sports growing up which has played a huge part in my life including soccer, basketball, table tennis, football, and others.

- ðŸ’» Software has grown to be something I'm greatly passionate about; I believe it's the perfect way for me to translate my love for solving problems, learning about technology, and creating cool stuff into the real world in a role where I can do all of these things.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning data structures and algorithms, React.JS/Node.JS, and SQL as I look to grow as a software engineer.
